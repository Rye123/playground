# ascender-descender-detection

## Problem Statement
Write a program to determine whether a word has any ascenders or descenders.
- **Ascender**: A part of lowercase letters that extends above the textline (`b, d, f, h, k, l, t`)
- **Descender**: A part of lowercase letters that descends beneath the textline. (`g, j, p, q, y`)

Extend that program to find the longest word in the dictionary with no ascenders or descenders.
